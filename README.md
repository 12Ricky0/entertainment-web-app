  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 9999;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;

}
````
````

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};

const bookmarkedMovies = data.filter((movie) => {
  return (
    bookmarkedResult &&
    bookmarkedResult.some((bookmark) => movie.title.includes(bookmark))
  );
});
```
