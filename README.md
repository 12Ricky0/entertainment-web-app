## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

```css
.loading-spinner {
  display: none;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 9999;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};

const bookmarkedMovies = data.filter((movie) => {
  return (
    bookmarkedResult &&
    bookmarkedResult.some((bookmark) => movie.title.includes(bookmark))
  );
});
```

### Continued development

- MERN Stack: Build more advanced projects as a full stack so I can easily integrate the backend whe the frontend.
- React Router: Explore the various aspects of the react router.
